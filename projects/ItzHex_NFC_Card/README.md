# ItzHex_NFC_Card
## Summary
I made an NFC Business card. It features some cool space art and a QR code to get to my website.

## Plan
##### How much is it going to cost?

## Design
##### Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional***
Was pretty simple to do. The art was fun to make and was a good learning experiences on how to make PCBs.
